#Unofficial Roll20 Sheet for Glitch

This repository contains a character sheet for _Glitch: A Story of the Not_ by Jenna Moran.
It's modelled on the sample character sheet at the end of the book.

The project consists of two files: an HTML file describing the fields and character attributes, and a CSS file describing their layout and styling.
Full instructions for adding this sheet to a campaign in Roll20 can be found on the [Roll20 Wiki](https://wiki.roll20.net/Using_Custom_Character_Sheets)

The character sheet has three tabs:
- Attributes, modelled on the sample sheet provided in Glitch
- Quests, holding the five quest slots along with banked XP
- Wounds, holding both active wounds and the total damage accumulated.

Roadmap:
- Replace some of the large text boxes with repeating sections.
- Add automation for Wounds, creating the Wound and updating the Costs as one action.
