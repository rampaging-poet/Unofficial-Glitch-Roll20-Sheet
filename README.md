#Unofficial Roll20 Sheet for Glitch

This repository contains a character sheet for _Glitch: A Story of the Not_ by Jenna Moran.
It's modelled on the sample character sheet at the end of the book.

The project consists of two files: an HTML file describing the fields and character attributes, and a CSS file describing their layout and styling.
Full instructions for adding this sheet to a campaign in Roll20 can be found on the [Roll20 Wiki](https://wiki.roll20.net/Using_Custom_Character_Sheets)

Version 0.1 uses large, free-form text-boxes to record information like gifts, geasa, and Treasures.

Roadmap:
- Basic support for Quests and XP tracking.
- Replace some of the large text boxes with repeating sections.
